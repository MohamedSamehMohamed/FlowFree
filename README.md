# FlowFree
This is a script for solving Flow Free Android Game 

### Python and C++

#### Algorithm
After reading the game status, we create a list of pairs [x1, y1, x2, y2] and we want to find paths that each pair [x1, y1] reach [x2, y2] 

without conflict between any two paths or pass throw a colored cell 

We just run a standard backtrack algorithm and try all possible paths
